        "desc": "Licious Lamb Keema/Mince is made using boneless cuts of cleaned meat. The pieces are ground to perfection to create a fine mince. This mince is easy to eat; it is not chewy but soft and tender.\n\nIn terms of flavour, lamb mince is gamey and also earthy. As lamb is taken from younger sheep or goats, the meat is fattier, however, this fat melts when cooked to add even more flavour to your dishes. Licious Lamb Mince is a perfect blend of lamb meat and fat.\n\nOur combo pack is meant for larger families or perhaps big meals planned for special occasions. Each pack contains enough mince to feed up to 4 people. As lamb mince is boneless, it is a great choice for kids' meals. Lamb mince is a versatile option for various cuisines and styles of cooking. Use it in pasta, curries, for tasty kebabs, juicy koftas and more.\n\nLicious Lamb Mince has been made using cleaned boneless pieces and therefore can be used straight from the pack. To retain the taste, texture and flavour of the mince, please do not wash it.\n",
